# Jest Customizations
This directory includes changes used for extending Jest to do things like stub and spy on private functions.

Followed instructions from [here](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/01/30/jest-add-custom-functions/).

To add more custom testing functions, add them to `jest/jest.setupt.ts` and `jest.d.ts`.

## API
### `stub`
Used to stub a class function with the given return value.

```ts
test.stub(MyClass.prototype, 'myFunction', {});
```

### `fail`
Jest does not have a way to force fail a function.
```ts
test.fail();
```
