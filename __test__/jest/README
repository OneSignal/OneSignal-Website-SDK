# Basic Test

Here is a basic test file template.

```ts
import { TestEnvironment } from '../../support/environment/TestEnvironment';

// mock an entire file
jest.mock('../../../src/MyFile');

describe('My tests', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    jest.useFakeTimers();
    TestEnvironment.initialize();
  });

  afterEach(() => {
    jest.resetAllMocks();
  });

  test('This is a test description', () => {});
});
```

# Common Usages

## Suppress Internal Logging

Your test may result in an error being printed but the test still succeeds. To suppress logs, you can mock the entire Log file.

```ts
// suppress all internal logging
jest.mock('../../../src/shared/libraries/Log');
```

# Jest Customizations

This directory includes changes used for extending Jest to do things like stub and spy on private functions.

Followed instructions from [here](https://spin.atomicobject.com/2020/01/30/jest-add-custom-functions/).

To add more custom testing functions, add them to `jest/jest.setupt.ts` and `jest.d.ts`.

## API

### `stub`

Used to stub a class function with the given mock return value.

```ts
test.stub(MyClass.prototype, 'myFunction', {});
```

### `fail`

Jest does not have a way to force fail a function.

```ts
test.fail();
```

### `nock`

Mocks all HTTP requests by replacing the `fetch` function. If omitted, the status defaults to 200.

```ts
test.nock({}, 404);
```

# Troubleshooting

## `jest.spyOn()` vs `test.stub()`

`test.stub()`'s internal implementation is the same as `jest.spyOn()` with the difference that the `stub` function has the option to set the mock return value. **Warning**: setting the mock return value can change the behavior of nested functions. For example, if an outer function calls a function you expect to be called once -- and you set a mock return value on the outer function, your test comparison may fail.
