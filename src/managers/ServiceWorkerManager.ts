  /**
   * Installs a newer version of the OneSignal service worker.

   * We have a couple different models of installing service workers:
   *
   * a) Originally, we provided users with two worker files:
   * OneSignalSDKWorker.js and OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js. Two workers were
   * provided so each could be swapped with the other when the worker needed to
   * update. The contents of both workers were identical; only the filenames
   * were different, which is enough to update the worker.
   *
   * b) With AMP web push, users are to specify only the first worker file
   * OneSignalSDKWorker.js, with an app ID parameter ?appId=12345. AMP web push
   * is vendor agnostic and doesn't know about OneSignal, so all relevant
   * information has to be passed to the service worker, which is the only
   * vendor-specific file. So the service worker being installed is always
   * OneSignalSDKWorker.js?appId=12345 and never OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js.
   * If AMP web push sees another worker like OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js, or
   * even the same OneSignalSDKWorker.js without the app ID query parameter, the
   * user is considered unsubscribed.
   *
   * c) Due to b's restriction, we must always install
   * OneSignalSDKWorker.js?appId=xxx. We also have to appropriately handle
   * legacy cases:
   *
   *    c-1) Where developers have OneSignalSDKWorker.js or
   *    OneSignalSDKUpdaterWorker.js alternatingly installed
   *
   *    c-2) Where developers running progressive web apps force-register
   *    OneSignalSDKWorker.js
   *
   * Actually, users can customize the file names of Worker A / Worker B, but
   * it's up to them to be consistent with their naming. For AMP web push, users
   * can specify the full string to expect for the service worker. They can add
   * additional query parameters, but this must then stay consistent.
   *
   * Installation Procedure
   * ----------------------
   *
   * Worker A is always installed. If Worker A is already installed, Worker B is
   * installed first, and then Worker A is installed again. This is necessary
   * because AMP web push requires Worker A to be installed for the user to be
   * considered subscribed.
